# ABSTRACT
This study focuses on energy-efficient green scheduling in a two-machine flowshop under rising energy costs and strict environmental rules. A mixed-integer linear programming model handles sequence-dependent setups, idle power and discrete speed options while optimising makespan, energy use, processing time and idle time. Two single-solution metaheuristics address the NP-hard problem. Tabu search uses a dynamic tabu list and aspiration criteria. Simulated annealing relies on calibrated temperature and cooling. Fifty benchmarks were used, which reveal clear scale effects. Tabu search excels for four to fifty jobs while simulated annealing gives strong trade-offs for eighty jobs.
